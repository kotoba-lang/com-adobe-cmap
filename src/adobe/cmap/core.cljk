  "Adobe's CID-to-Unicode CMaps, parsed.

  ## What these answer

  A PDF composite font names a character collection — `Adobe-Japan1`,
  `Adobe-GB1`, `Adobe-CNS1`, `Adobe-KR`, `Adobe-Korea1` — and puts CIDs in
  the content stream. `/ToUnicode` is how a producer is supposed to say what
  those CIDs mean, and 25 of 576 `/Type0` fonts in a measured corpus do not
  ship one. For those the collection's own table is the answer, and Adobe
  publishes it.

  This is a **vendored resource**, not a clean-room reimplementation. The
  files under `resources/adobe/cmap/` are Adobe's, byte for byte, under the
  BSD-3-Clause licence reproduced beside them. Retyping a 23,000-entry
  mapping would introduce errors nobody could find; the whole value here is
  that it is Adobe's table and not somebody's transcription of it.

  ## The parser is not the PDF one, and that is deliberate

  These files are `beginbfchar`/`beginbfrange` — the same syntax a PDF
  `/ToUnicode` stream uses, so a reader already exists in `kotoba-lang/hanmen`.
  Depending on a PDF renderer to read a font resource would be backwards, and
  the parser is thirty lines. Two small parsers beat a dependency pointing
  the wrong way.

  ## Loading

  `cid->unicode` reads a resource, which is a host effect and JVM-only —
  `.cljc` here is for the parser, which is pure and portable. A caller on
  another platform reads the bytes itself and calls `parse`.")

(def orderings
  "The collections with a published table, and the file each lives in.

  `Adobe-Identity` is deliberately absent: it declares that the CIDs mean
  whatever the font says they mean, so there is no table to publish and a
  font using it without `/ToUnicode` is not decodable by anyone."
